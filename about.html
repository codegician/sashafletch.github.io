          <h3>Origins</h3>
          <p>I’m originally from Royal Palm Beach, Florida but I now live in Oakland, California.  After completing my undergraduate degree in Psychology and Anthropology, I pursued a graduate program in Education and worked as a teacher and college counselor for several years.</p>

              <p>My road to UX Design has been filled with a lot of twists and turns, but my background in psychology, anthropology, and education has informed my design experience, helping me to build creative and empathetic solutions for users. </p>
              <p>As a teacher for several years and as a graduate student, I had to create and design educational content for students. Curriculum design is an iterative and dynamic process in which teachers must account for students’ different learning styles, levels of understanding, and paces of growth. While teachers are often experienced in the field and thus understand more advanced topics, this can sometimes create a barrier to empathizing with students who have trouble grasping basic concepts. In the educational system, the focus on factual knowledge often leads teachers to mistakenly assume that their understanding of information can simply be transferred to their students. The foundation of the trajectory from novice-level to expert-level thinking is empathy; teachers need to be sensitive to the needs of their students and understand how each student learns. I consistently put myself into the shoes of my students and re-evaluated how my methods either aided their journey or exacerbated misunderstandings.
              </p>
              <p>In effect, my time as a teacher introduced me to the iterative design process; I created a systematic approach to mapping content to learning objectives. Each objective was defined by assessment strategies and content analysis that then informed my design process moving forward. It consistently demanded that I think creatively to solve problems of misunderstanding, behavior intervention, and classroom management.</p>

        <h2>The Importance of Design</h2>
        <div class="horizontal_line"></div>
        <div class="container importance_design">
          <p>Part of what makes design important enough for me to pursue full-time is that it has introduced me to an industry that I thought was inaccessible for someone with my background. Traditionally, the tech world is often seen as a monolith but the introduction of careers like UX have broadened opportunities for those who may not find an interest in computer science but are still fascinated by advancements in technology and the tech industry.</p>
          <p>For most of my life, I intended to become a psychotherapist or work in psychology research because of the field’s focus on improving other’s lived experiences through communication and analysis. I have always had a desire to understand behaviors by carefully evaluating cognitive processes. Whether I was seeing psychology through a social lens or a neurological lens, I was consistently fascinated by the influences behind individual behavior and thinking.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons I decided not to pursue a career in psychology research was because of how isolated findings were from those that really needed it; much of the information and research findings are usually dispersed within the academic populace at the expense of the public. Information is usually too embroiled in technical terminology and academic language, making it inaccessible to those not familiar with the field. Within UX, research is used intentionally to create better experiences for the general user.</p>
