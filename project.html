            <h2 class="vertical_line">Lupo Cloud Storage</h2>
            <p>Cloud storage has become a staple tool for users and has shifted how they work, interact, and share information. However, while there are many platforms, there is still room for changing interactions on the cloud. Lupo is a cloud storage site that focuses on collaboration, capitalizing on the rise of remote work across industries.</p>

          <div class="row container">
            <div class="column one-half">
              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p>The cloud storage and organization market is relatively young but has helped shape how information is stored and shared. But many advanced features are not accessible under a free subscription and collaborative options are limited even under paid options.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column one-half">
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>Lupo extends collaborative features by allowing users to develop teams with a team lead, keeping all members up-to-date about changes to documents and other files. Team members can add text, video, and audio comments; diversifying methods of collaboration inspires more creativity and furthers communication.</p>

  <!--User Research-->
          <h3>Early Insights</h3>
          <p>To understand what users are looking for in cloud storage, I conducted a survey that was posted online through various social media platforms and public forums. I also wanted to better understand how users viewed major cloud storage sites like Google Drive and Dropbox; what did they think was missing?</p>

            <p>Lupo capitalizes on the lack of brand symbols within the cloud storage market to distinguish itself. With it’s focus on collaboration, innovation, and reliability, a familiar cultural representation is that of a wolf. Culturally, these animals are admired for their tenacity and ability to band together for a common goal; they are often seen as majestic animals with a keen intelligence, which are all traits Lupo sees in it’s users as collaborators on the platform.</p>

                  <p> I chose purple as the core color for Lupo with yellow and orange as supporting colors. Yellow is often associated with happiness and energy; orange is said to stimulate confidence and mental activity. And finally, purple is historically associated with royalty from the Roman Empire. The use of purple as a primary brand identifier corroborates its association with wisdom, creativity, and sophistication. <br> Poiret One was chosen as the headline typeface and Lato as the body typeface. Poiret One has very clean lines with very strong geometric shapes that is in alignment with the professional purpose of the site. I decided on Lato because it complements the header with the same level of simplicity and geometric shapes. While slightly decorative, it doesn’t add too much detail that would distract from the overall refined theme of the site but does add interest.</p>

            <h3>The Tests</h3>
            <article class="slider">
              <p>Before finalizing my high-fidelity mockups, there were still a few questions I had concerning the user interface. So, I conducted preference tests on Usabilityhub to better inform my design process. The first preference test  looked at the organization of comments on the document home page, the second compared the color of the sign-up page, and the final preference test compared the design of the landing page. Initial usability tests showed that users were focusing on different areas of the page upon it’s initiation, subtly suggesting a weak visual hierarchy and organization. </p>

              <p>Along with preference tests, I conducted a few more usability tests before completing my final design. Usability tests  generated some important additional information that users preferred to see, such as including pricing information on the Account Settings home page, adding a leader to the group profile, the ability for users to make certain documents public to invite collaboration, and including the name of the document the users last collaborated on.</p>

                  <p>While there were many triumphs in the completion of this project primarily because of user feedback, market research, and user testing, there were also some lessons I learned as a designer. One of my main mistakes working on this project was my inclination to change direction based on an individual user’s opinion without carefully considering whether their opinion was an outlier or representative of the norm. Moving forward, I would be more persistent in clarifying the distinction so as not to make arbitrary changes to a design at the expense of other users.<br>Furthermore, I think it is important that I spend more time further developing my sketches. When starting a new project, my excitement often drives me to want to begin designing the interface as soon as possible. However, especially in larger projects, it is very important to fully explore all possible alternatives before deciding on a final design. I think had I worked slower in the beginning, there wouldn’t have been a need for as many small iterations from simple mistakes or gaps in user input. Moving forward, my main goal as a designer will be to further develop my patience in the Strategy phase.
